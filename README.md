# YOLO

YOLO helps you deploy high-availability PHP applications on AWS.

The CLI tool takes care of provisioning and configuring all required resources on AWS, coupled with build and deployment
commands to deploy applications to production from your local machine or CI pipeline.

___

### Disclaimer

YOLO is designed for PHP developers who want to manage AWS using an infrastructure-as-code approach, using plain-old PHP
rather than CloudFormation / Terraform / K8s / Elastic Beanstalk / <some-other-exotic-alternative>.

While YOLO has been battle-tested on apps serving millions of requests per day, it is not supposed to be a
set-and-forget solution for busy apps, but rather allows you to grow and adapt your infrastructure as requirements
change over time.

Within the Laravel ecosystem there are several high quality commercial alternatives like Forge, Vapor and Cloud, which
require less working knowledge of AWS.

It goes without saying, but YOLO at your own risk.

### Prerequisites

YOLO uses AWS profiles for authentication, so before getting started, install the AWS CLI tool.

You'll also need an AWS account and at least some basic knowledge of AWS services.

## Installation

### Install With Composer

```bash
composer require codinglabsau/yolo
```

## Usage

The entry point to the YOLO CLI is `vendor/bin/yolo` or `yolo` if you have `./vendor/bin` in your path.

### Permissions & Authentication

YOLO uses AWS profiles stored in `~/.aws/credentials` for authentication. You'll need to set a
`YOLO_{ENVIRONMENT}_AWS_PROFILE` in the app `.env` file to point to the correct profile; eg.
`YOLO_PRODUCTION_AWS_PROFILE=my-project-profile`.

Once configured, future operations will authenticate using the profile.

Note that for CI environments, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are used instead. Ensure that any access
keys provided in CI are using least-privileged scope as a safety guard against accidental AWS resource modification.

### `yolo init`

Initalises the yolo.yml file in the app with a boilerplate production environment, and adds some entries to
`.gitignore`.

After initialising, you can customise the `yolo.yml` manifest file to suit your app's requirements.

### Sync Commands

After initialising YOLO manifest, all remaining infrastructure commands are prefixed with `sync:`.

The sync commands are:

- `yolo sync:network <environment>` prepares the VPC, subnets, security groups and SSH keys
- `yolo sync:domain <environment>` prepares domain resources (standard apps only)
- `yolo sync:landlord <environment>` prepares landlord resources (multitenancy apps only)
- `yolo sync:tenant <environment>` prepares tenant resources (multitenancy apps only)
- `yolo sync:compute <environment>` prepares the compute resources
- `yolo sync:ci <environment>` prepares the continuous integration pipeline

### `yolo ami:create <environment>`

With all low-level resource provisioned, the next step is to create an AMI for EC2s. All server types will utilise this
AMI.

### `yolo prepare <environment>`

Prepares autoscaling groups, EC2 launch template and alarms.

### `yolo env:push <environment>`

Prior to building the environment, you'll need to create `.env.<environment>` followed by `yolo env:push <environment>`.

### `yolo build <environment>`

The build command takes care of building a deployment-ready directory in `./yolo`.

### `yolo deploy <environment>`

The build command takes care of building and deploying. You can run this locally, or in CI. The deploy command will call
the build step for you if a local build does not exist.

## Full yolo.yml example

This is a complete yolo.yml file, showing default values where applicable.

Note that some keys are intentionally omitted from the stub generated by `yolo init`.

```yaml

    build:
      - composer install --no-cache --no-interaction --optimize-autoloader --no-progress --classmap-authoritative --no-dev
